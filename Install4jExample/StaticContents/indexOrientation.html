				<p>One of the most common cases for orientation changes is when you want to revise the layout of your content based on the orientation of the device. For example, perhaps you want a button bar to stretch along the longest dimension of the device's display. By using a media query, you can do this easily and automatically.</p>

	<h2>Locking the screen orientation</h2>
	<p>Some devices (mainly mobile devices) can dynamically change the orientation of the screen based on their own orientation to make sure that the user will always be able to read what's on the screen. If this behavior is perfectly suited for text content, there is some content that can suffer such a change. For example, games based on the orientation of the device could be messed up by such a change of the orientation.</p>
